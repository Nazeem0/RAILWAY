# Railway Safety Management System

This repository contains the Railway Safety Management System demo built with Vite, React and Tailwind.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Lovable branding and related assets were removed from this repo. The project no longer depends on `lovable-tagger`.
Open Graph and favicon image is now `public/train.svg` — a single custom vector train SVG used for both social previews and the site icon.

If you want the old Lovable integration restored, mention it and I can add it back behind an opt-in flag.
